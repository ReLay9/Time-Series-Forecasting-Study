    "# Exponential Smoothing  \n",
    "\n",
    "Exponential Smoothing is a time series forecasting technique that assigns exponentially decreasing weights to past observations. It's particularly useful for capturing trends and seasonal patterns in data. There are different variations of Exponential Smoothing models, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple Exponential Smoothing: Suitable for data with no trend or seasonality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Holt's Linear Exponential Smoothing: Incorporates linear trends in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additive and Multiplicative Exponential Smoothing: Used when seasonality is present, with additive for constant seasonal effects and multiplicative for proportional effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Damped Exponential Smoothing: Adds a damping factor to account for a diminishing trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "By trying different configurations and models, this code aims to find the Exponential Smoothing model that best fits the historical stock price data and provides accurate forecasts for future prices."
